            <p>I am a web developer, with a background in Aviation Management,
            and spent around the last 8 years or so managing restaurants.
            I eventually became a Division manager and watched over 7 stores
            all around florida. I decided I could make more of a differene 
            with Web Development and so moved up to Pennsylvania to make a 
            change.</p>
        
            <p>With the support of the Upenn Bootcamp powered by triology
            I plan to make my switch complete. I am aspiring to work a 
            variety of different companies, to help create an impact in 
            the world via the internet. I plan to use this skill and 
            knowledge to help out businesses and creators get a message 
            out in the world; with style I might add. Please look around
            enjoy my work, and let me know how I can improve your digital
            fingerprint.</p>
